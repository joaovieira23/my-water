## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed by me, for the purpose of studies and practice with the following technologies:

-  [React Native Gesture Handler](https://kmagiera.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/)
-  [React Native Circular Progress](https://github.com/bartgryszko/react-native-circular-progress)
-  [VS Code][vc]

## :warning: Prerequisites

In order to use and test the app on a simulator or on your smartphone, you should've already setup the development environment for React Native applications. You can follow the following article (PT-BR) to setup your environment:
